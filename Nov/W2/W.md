## Printers


### Non Impact Printers
Features: No Hammer, No ribbon. Thermal Special paper Chain printer with burning paper Ink Jet Printers Very special link dries instantly. `Very Expensive`

## Monitors
CRT, LCD(LED), Or newer

```
monitor = video display terminal(VDT) or video display unit(VDU)
used to display images, text, video, and graphics information generated by a connected computer via a computer's video card

CRT => older minotors were built by using a fluorescent screen and Cathode Ray Tube(CRT)
```


## Graphic Cards
CGA, EGA, VGA, SVGA

System Software
=> a type of computer program that is designed to run a computer's hardware and application programs
=> SS inlcudes OS, Computing, boot loader, compiler, shell, device driver, library, linker...
=> SS is Machine Dependency???

OS 
=> Manage Hardware like CPU memory, harddisk, communictaing computers..

Assemblers
=> Translate assemly language to machine language
=> process of reading 2 time (2-pass)


Compiler and Interpreters
=> high level programming language to assembly language

# Algorithms

Assignment _ 1. Algorithm for changing a flat tire
```
K-16
Condition: Thread is less than... OR seeable inner layer. Normally 18~30  layers (Cars = 4~8 layers). OR found infection of tire (crack..)
Tools: Hydraulic Jack, Handbar, Torque rench (150~300), `3mm` wire, Wire Twister, + driver, New Tire, Oil, Hexagon(mostly), cutter, Tire greese

Step 1. Check Jack's oil level to prevent accident
Step 1_1. If oil level is low, fill oil

Step 2. Jack up
Step 2_1. Chock oposite tire(Wheel Wedge)
Step 2_2. Position Jack at a right bottom of jack point which is placed on landing gear
Step 2_3. UP until tire has enough space on bottom(thred + obstacles + check... approxi.. 3cm)

Step 3. Unassembly
Step 3_1. Remove wire with Cutter
Step 3_2. Unscrew bolts
Step 3_3. Untorque
Step 3_4. Remove bearings
Step 3_5. Remove wheel

Step 4. Inspection
Step 4_1. Inspect disks if there are any damages or obstacle, and cleaning
Step 4_2. Make sure all disk layers are on a same position


Step 5. Assembly
Step 5_1. Put greese on threads before put tire on
Step 5_2. Put tire on the position
Step 5_3. Check tire rotation
Step 5_4. Put bearings on
Step 5_5. Check tire rotation
Step 5_6. Torque bearings witn torque wrench and socket
Step 5_7. Check tire rotation
Step 5_8. screw bolts
Step 5_9. do wire safety work with wire twister
Step 5_10. Check tire rotation
Step 5_11. Check obstacles before unloading jack and clear area
Step 5_12. Unloading
End
