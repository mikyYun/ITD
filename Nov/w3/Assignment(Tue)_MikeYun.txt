1. write a for loop that prints all the numbers from 1 - 100
```js
// pseudo
// for num = 1, increase num up to 100
// print num  
```
2. write a for loop that prints the multiples of 3 up to 100
```js
  // pseudo
  // for num = 1, increase num up to 100 by 1
  //   print num * 3 
```

3. write a for loop to 100 that prints out:
```
fizz if its a multiple of 3
buzz if its a multiple of 5
fizzbuzz if its a multiple of 3 and 5
```
```js
// num starts from 0
// increase by 1 up to 1000
  // make a variable string with empty string
  // if num is divisible by 3 AND 5, string is "fizBuzz"
  // else if num is divisible by 3, string is "fizz"
  // else if num is divisible by 5, string is "buzz"
  // print string
```

4. make a while loop that runs while temperature is below 21 degrees and increases the heat in the room
```js
// temperature = 20
// while temperature is less then 21
  // increase temperature => turn on the heat
```

5. make a variable for book price make a variable for budget book price is 25$, budget is 85$. Use a while loop that can determine how many books you can buy
```js
// book price is 25
// budget is 85
// total count starts from 0
// while budget is less than book price
  // count ++
  // budget - book price

//// while book price * count is less than budget - book price
  //// count ++
// print count

```
